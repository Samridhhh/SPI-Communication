# SPI-Communication
Designed SPI Master‑Slave communication in Verilog on Boolean FPGA board, enabling full‑duplex data exchange via 8‑bit shift registers and SPI clock. Used push‑buttons for reset/start and LEDs for transmission check. Achieved bi‑directional communication with edge‑triggered sampling.
